"The following conventions apply to the website as a whole, including "
"everything written in HTML, CSS, YAML, and Liquid. These conventions are "
"intended to keep the codebase consistent when multiple collaborators are "
"working on it. They should be understood as a practical set of rules for "
"maintaining order in this specific codebase rather than as a statement of "
"what is objectively right or good."
