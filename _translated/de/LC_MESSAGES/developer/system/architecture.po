"Qubes implements a security-by-compartmentalization approach. To do this, "
"Qubes utilizes virtualization technology in order to isolate various "
"programs from each other and even to sandbox many system-level components, "
"such as networking and storage subsystems, so that the compromise of any of "
"these programs or components does not affect the integrity of the rest of "
"the system."

"Qubes lets the user define many secure compartments known as :ref:`qubes "
"<user/reference/glossary:qube>`, which are implemented as lightweight "
":ref:`virtual machines (VMs) <user/reference/glossary:vm>`. For example, the"
" user can have “personal,” “work,” “shopping,” “bank,” and “random” app "
"qubes and can use the applications within those qubes just as if they were "
"executing on the local machine. At the same time, however, these "
"applications are well isolated from each other. Qubes also supports secure "
"copy-and-paste and file sharing between qubes, of course."
