"issue is simply a way for you to submit an item for the Qubes team’s "
"consideration. It is up to the Qubes team to decide whether or how to "
"address your issue, which may include closing the issue without taking any "
"action on it. Even if your issue is kept open, however, you should not "
"expect it to be addressed within any particular time frame, or at all. At "
"the time of this writing, there are well over one thousand open issues in "
"`qubes-issues <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues>`__. The Qubes"
" team has its own roadmap and priorities, which will govern the manner and "
"order in which open issues are addressed."
