"The short version is that we try to respect your privacy as much as "
"possible. We absolutely do not sell any user data. In fact, we go out of our"
" way to help you keep your data private from everyone, including us. For "
"example, from the moment you :doc:`install Qubes OS </user/downloading-"
"installing-upgrading/installation-guide>`, we offer to set up `Whonix "
"<https://www.whonix.org/>`__ so that all of your updates are routed through "
"`Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`__."

"This is just a static website generated with Jekyll and hosted from GitHub "
"Pages. We try to use as little JavaScript as possible. We host all resources"
" locally (no third-party CDNs) so that you only have to connect to one "
"domain. This site should be easy to browse using Tor Browser and with "
"scripts blocked. We also have an `onion service "
"<http://qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion/>`__ "
"(access is not logged). We even go out of our way to make it easy to "
"download `this website’s git repo "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/qubesos.github.io>`__, including all the website"
" source code, so that you can host this entire site from your own local "
"machine offline. Better yet, we’ve specifically written all of the "
"`documentation </>`__ in Markdown so that the plain text can be enjoyed from"
" the comfort of your terminal. Here’s the `repo "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc>`__. (By the way, Git tags on our "
"repos are PGP-signed so you can :doc:`verify </project-security/verifying-"
"signatures>` the authenticity of the content.) Obviously, we don’t use any "
"ads or trackers, but this is still a public website, so man-in-the-middle "
"attacks and such are always a possibility. Please be careful. See :ref:`FAQ:"
" Should I trust this website? <introduction/faq:should i trust this "
