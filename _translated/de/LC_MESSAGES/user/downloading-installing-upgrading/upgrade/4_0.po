"One of differences between R3.2 and R4.0 is the handling of disposables. In "
"R3.2, a disposable inherited its network settings (NetVM and firewall rules)"
" from the calling qube. In R4.0, this is no longer the case. Instead, in "
"R4.0 it’s possible to create multiple disposable templates and choose which "
"one should be used by each qube. It’s even possible to use different "
"disposable templates for different operations from the same qube. This "
"allows much more flexibility, since it allows you to differentiate not only "
"network settings, but all of a qube’s properties (including its template, "
"memory settings, etc.)."

"Restoring a backup from R3.2 preserves the old behavior by creating separate"
