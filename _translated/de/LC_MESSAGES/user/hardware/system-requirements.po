"Qubes **can** be installed on a USB flash drive or external disk, and "
"testing has shown that this works very well. A fast USB 3.0 flash drive is "
"recommended for this. (As a reminder, its capacity must be at least 32 GiB.)"
" Simply plug the flash drive into the computer before booting into the Qubes"
" installer from a separate installation medium, choose the flash drive as "
"the target installation disk, and proceed with the installation normally. "
"After Qubes has been installed on the flash drive, it can then be plugged "
"into other computers in order to boot into Qubes. In addition to the "
"convenience of having a portable copy of Qubes, this allows users to test "
"for hardware compatibility on multiple machines (e.g., at a brick-and-mortar"
" computer store) before deciding on which computer to purchase. (See "
":ref:`generating and submitting HCL    reports <user/hardware/how-to-use-"
"the-hcl:generating and submitting new reports>` for advice on hardware "
"compatibility testing.) Remember to change the devices assigned to your "
"NetVM and USB VM if you move between different machines."
