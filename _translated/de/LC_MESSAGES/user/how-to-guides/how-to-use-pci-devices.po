"**Warning:** Only dom0 exposes PCI devices. Some of them are strictly "
"required in dom0 (e.g., the host bridge). You may end up with an unusable "
"system by attaching the wrong PCI device to a VM. PCI passthrough should be "
"safe by default, but non-default options may be required. Please make sure "
"you carefully read and understand the :ref:`security considerations "
"<user/security-in-qubes/device-handling-security:pci security>` before "

"Unlike other devices (( :doc:`USB </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-"
"devices>`, :doc:`block </user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-block-storage-"

"how you can’t attach a new sound-card after your computer booted (and expect"
" it to work properly), attaching PCI devices to already booted VMs isn’t "
"supported. Moreover, PCI devices can be attached only to VMs running in "
"certain virtualization modes. See :ref:`FAQ: Which virtualization modes do "
"VMs use? <introduction/faq:which virtualization modes do vms use>`"

"While PCI device can only be used by one powered on VM at a time, it *is* "

"different VM (to which the same device is now attached), then use the device"
" in that VM. This can be useful if, for example, you have only one USB "
