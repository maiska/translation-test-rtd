"In :doc:`Getting Started </introduction/getting-started>`, we covered the "
"distinction in Qubes OS between where you *install* your software and where "
"you *run* your software. Your software is installed in :ref:`templates "
"<user/reference/glossary:template>`. Each template shares its root "
"filesystem (i.e., all of its programs and system files) with all the qubes "
"based on it. :ref:`App qubes <user/reference/glossary:app qube>` are where "
"you run your software and store your data."
