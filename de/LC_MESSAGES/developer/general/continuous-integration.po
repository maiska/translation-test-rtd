"``TestDeploy``: Deploys a test website, which is a live version of the Qubes"
" website as if this PR had been merged. This can be useful for previewing a "
"PR on a live public website. **Note:** You must wait for the site to finish "
"building before issuing this command, or else it will deploy an empty "
"website. To find the URL of the test website, look for text similar to “This"
" branch was successfully deployed” and a button named something like “View "
"deployment.” Note that there are two different testing sites: ``wwwtest`` is"
" manually updated, whereas ``wwwpreview`` is managed by the ``TestDeploy`` "
"command."
