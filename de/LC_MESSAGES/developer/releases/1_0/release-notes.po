"On some systems the KDE Window Manager might freeze upon resuming from S3 "

"system if this happens is to switch to a text console, enter your user’s "
"password, kill the kwin process, go back to the Xorg console, log in, and "

"such problems, make sure to disable compositing before putting the system "
"into sleep by pressing Alt-Ctrl-F12 (and then enabling it back once you log "
"in after resume) – this way you should never see this problem again."

"default template in RC1, you should tell qvm-back-restore about that by "
"passing ``--replace-template`` option:"
