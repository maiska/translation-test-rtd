"Normally there should be few reasons for updating software in Dom0. This is "
"because there is no networking in Dom0, which means that even if some bugs "
"will be discovered e.g. in the Dom0 Desktop Manager, this really is not a "
"problem for Qubes, because all the third-party software running in Dom0 is "
"not accessible from VMs or network in any way. Some exceptions to the above "
"include: Qubes GUI daemon, Xen store daemon, and disk back-ends (we plan to "
"move the disk backends to untrusted domain in Qubes 2.0). Of course we "
"believe this software is reasonably secure and we hope it will not need "
"patching."

"Dom0 is the most trusted domain on Qubes OS, and for this reason we decided "
"to design Qubes in such a way that Dom0 is not connected to any network. In "
"fact only certain domains can be connected to a network via so-called "
"network domains. There can also be more than one network domain, e.g. in "
"case the user is connected to more than one physically or logically "
"separated networks."

"Updates (*.rpm files) are checked and downloaded by UpdateVM, which by "
