"No operating system, not even Qubes, can help you if you’re installing it on"
" hardware that is already compromised. This includes CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, HDDs,"
" the motherboard, BIOS/EFI/UEFI, and all relevant firmware. Unfortunately, "
"in today’s world of undetectable supply chain attacks, there are no easy "
"solutions. (Tools like :doc:`Anti Evil Maid (AEM) </user/security-in-"
"qubes/anti-evil-maid>` can help with *maintaining* the trustworthiness of "
"your hardware, but not with establishing it in the first place.) Some users "
"have chosen to use tools like `Coreboot <https://www.coreboot.org/>`__, "
"`Heads <http://osresearch.net/>`__, and `Skulls "

"You should :doc:`verify </project-security/verifying-signatures>` the PGP "
"signature on your Qubes ISO before you install from it. However, if the "
"machine on which you attempt the verification process is already "
"compromised, it could falsely claim that a malicious ISO has a good "
"signature. Therefore, in order to be certain that your Qubes ISO is "
"trustworthy, you require a trustworthy machine. But how can you be certain "
"*that* machine is trustworthy? Only by using another trusted machine, and so"
" forth. This is a `classic problem "
"<https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf>`__. "
"While various `solutions <https://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/>`__ have "
"been proposed, the point is that each user must ultimately make a choice "
"about whether to trust that a file is non-malicious."
