"One of the most important security improvements introduced with the release "
"of Qubes 4.0 was to replace paravirtualization (PV) technology with "
"**hardware-enforced memory virtualization**, which recent processors have "
"made possible thanks to so-called Second Level Address Translation (`SLAT "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation>`__), also "
"known as `EPT "
"<https://ark.intel.com/Search/FeatureFilter?productType=processors&ExtendedPageTables=true&MarketSegment=Mobile>`__"
" in Intel parlance. SLAT (EPT) is an extension to Intel VT-x virtualization,"
" which originally was capable of only CPU virtualization but not memory "
"virtualization and hence required a complex Shadow Page Tables approach. We "
"hope that embracing SLAT-based memory virtualization will allow us to "
"prevent disastrous security bugs, such as the infamous `XSA-148 "
"<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-148.html>`__, which — unlike many "
"other major Xen bugs — regrettably did `affect "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-"
"secpack/blob/master/QSBs/qsb-022-2015.txt>`__ Qubes OS. Consequently, we "
"require SLAT support of all certified hardware beginning with Qubes OS 4.0."

"Another important requirement is that Qubes-certified hardware should run "
"only **open-source boot firmware** (aka “the BIOS”), such as `coreboot "
"<https://www.coreboot.org/>`__. The only exception is the use of (properly "
"authenticated) CPU-vendor-provided blobs for silicon and memory "
"initialization (see `Intel FSP <https://firmware.intel.com/learn/fsp/about-"
"intel-fsp>`__) as well as other internal operations (see `Intel ME "
"<https://www.apress.com/9781430265719>`__). However, we specifically require"
" all code used for and dealing with the System Management Mode (SMM) to be "
"open-source."

"While we `recognize "
"<https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf>`__ the "
"potential problems that proprietary CPU-vendor code can cause, we are also "
"pragmatic enough to realize that we need to take smaller steps first, before"
" we can implement even stronger countermeasures such as a `stateless laptop "
"<https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/state_harmful.pdf>`__. A "
"switch to open source boot firmware is one such important step. To be "
"compatible with Qubes OS, the BIOS must properly expose all the VT-x, VT-d, "
"and SLAT functionality that the underlying hardware offers (and which we "
"require). Among other things, this implies **proper DMAR ACPI table** "
"construction."

"Finally, we require that Qubes-certified hardware does not have any built-in"
" *USB-connected* microphones (e.g. as part of a USB-connected built-in "
"camera) that cannot be easily physically disabled by the user, e.g. via a "
"convenient mechanical switch. Thankfully, the majority of laptops on the "
"market that we have seen already satisfy this condition out-of-the-box, "
"because their built-in microphones are typically connected to the internal "
"audio device, which itself is a type of PCIe device. This is important, "
"because such PCIe audio devices are — by default — assigned to Qubes’ "
"(trusted) dom0 and exposed through our carefully designed protocol only to "
"select app qubes when the user explicitly chooses to do so. The rest of the "
"time, they should be outside the reach of malware."
