"The inter-qube file copy system is secure because it doesn’t allow other "
"qubes to steal the files that are being copied, and it doesn’t allow the "
"source qube to overwrite arbitrary files on the destination qube. Moreover, "
"this system doesn’t use any sort of virtual block device for file copy. "
"Instead, we use Xen shared memory, which eliminates a lot of processing of "
"untrusted data. For example, the receiving qube is *not* forced to parse "
"untrusted partitions or file systems. In this respect, the inter-qube file "
"copy system provides even more security than file copy between two "
"physically separated (air-gapped) machines! (See `Software "
"compartmentalization vs. physical separation "
"<https://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/2014/Software_compartmentalization_vs_physical_separation.pdf>`__"
" for more on this.)"

"However, one should keep in mind that performing a data transfer from *less "
"trusted* to *more trusted* qubes is always potentially insecure if the data "
"will be parsed in the target qube. This is because the data that we copy "
"could try to exploit some hypothetical bug in software running in the target"
" qube. For example, a seemingly-innocent JPEG that we copy from an untrusted"
" qube might contain a specially-crafted exploit for a bug in a JPEG-parsing "
"application in the target qube. This is a general problem and applies to any"
" data transfer from *less trusted* to *more trusted* qubes. It even applies "
"to the scenario of copying files between air-gapped machines. Therefore, you"
" should always copy data only from *more trusted* to *less trusted* qubes."
