"Normally, the Qubes GUI virtualization daemon restricts the VM from “owning”"
" the full screen, ensuring that there are always clearly marked decorations "
"drawn by the trusted Window Manager around each of the VMs window. This "
"allows the user to easily realize to which domain a specific window belongs."

"If one allowed one of the VMs to “own” the full screen, e.g. to show a movie"
" on a full screen, it might not be possible for the user to know if the "
"applications/VM really “released” the full screen, or if it has started "
"emulating the whole desktop and is pretending to be the trusted Window "
"Manager, drawing shapes on the screen that look e.g. like other windows, "
"belonging to other domains (e.g. to trick the user into entering a secret "
"passphrase into a window that looks like belonging to some trusted domain)."

"However, it is possible to deal with fullscreen mode in a secure way "
"assuming there are mechanisms that can be used at any time to switch between"
" windows or show the full desktop and that cannot be intercepted by the VM. "
"The simplest example is the use of Alt+Tab for switching between windows, "
"which is a shortcut handled by dom0."

"Other examples such mechanisms are the KDE “Present Windows” and “Desktop "
"Grid” effects, which are similar to Mac’s “Expose” effect, and which can be "
"used to immediately detect potential “GUI forgery”, as they cannot be "
"intercepted by any of the VM (as the GUID never passes down the key "
"combinations that got consumed by KDE Window Manager), and so the VM cannot "
"emulate those. Those effects are enabled by default in KDE once Compositing "
"gets enabled in KDE (System Settings -> Desktop -> Enable Desktop Effects), "
"which is recommended anyway. By default, they are triggered by Ctrl-F8 and "
"Ctrl-F9 key combinations, but can also be reassigned to other shortcuts."

"You can always put a window into fullscreen mode in Xfce4 using the trusted "
"window manager by right-clicking on a window’s title bar and selecting "
"“Fullscreen” or pressing ``alt`` + ``f11``. This functionality should still "
"be considered safe, since a VM window still can’t voluntarily enter "
"fullscreen mode. The user must select this option from the trusted window "
"manager in dom0. To exit fullscreen mode from here, press ``alt`` + "
"``space`` to bring up the title bar menu again, then select “Leave "
"Fullscreen” or simply press ``alt`` + ``f11``. For StandaloneHVMs, you "
"should set the screen resolution in the qube to that of the host, (or "
"larger), *before* setting fullscreen mode in Xfce4."
