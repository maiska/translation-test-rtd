"Qubes OS is effectively a “meta” operating system (OS) that can run almost "
"any arbitrary OS inside of itself. For example, the way software is normally"
" installed in a Linux distribution (“distro”) is quite different from the "
"way software is normally installed in Windows. This isn’t up to Qubes. Qubes"
" is just the framework in which you’re running these other OSes. Therefore, "
"if you want to install software in a Linux template, for example, you should"
" do so in whatever way is normal for that Linux distro. Most Linux software "
"is distributed via `packages "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_format>`__, which are stored in "
"`software repositories "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository>`__ (“repos”). `Package "
"managers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager>`__ handle "
"downloading, installing, updating, and removing packages. (Again, none of "
"this is Qubes-specific.) If you’re not familiar with how software is "
"normally installed in Linux distros via package managers or the software you"
" want doesn’t seem to be available in your distro’s repos (or you’re in "
"another situation not covered on this page), please read this `community "
"guide to installing software in Qubes <https://forum.qubes-"
"os.org/t/9991/>`__."
