"To access an optical disc via USB follow the :ref:`typical procedure for "
"attaching a USB device <user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-devices:with the "
"command line tool>`, then check with the **Qubes Devices** widget to see "
"what device in the target qube the USB optical drive was attached to. "
"Typically this would be ``sr0``. For example, if ``sys-usb`` has device "
"``3-2`` attached to the ``work`` qube’s ``sr0``, you would mount it with "
"``mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/removable``. You could also write to a disc with "
"``wodim -v dev=/dev/sr0 -eject /home/user/Qubes.iso``."
