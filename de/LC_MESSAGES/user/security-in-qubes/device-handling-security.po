"For example, attaching a full USB-device offers `more attack surface than "
"attaching a single block device "
"<https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/05/31/usb-security-"
"challenges.html>`__, while attaching a full block device (e.g. ``sda``) "
"again offers more attack surface than attaching a single partition "
"(e.g. ``sda1``), since the targetVM doesn’t have to parse the partition-"
"table. (Attaching a full block device offers the advantage that most file-"
"managers will mount and display them correctly, whereas they don’t expect "
"single partitions to be added and therefore don’t handle them correctly.)"

"Attaching a PCI device to a qube has serious security implications. It "
"exposes the device driver running in the qube to an external device (and "
"sourceVM, which contains the device - e.g. ``sys-usb``). In many cases a "
"malicious device can choose what driver will be loaded (for example by "
"manipulating device metadata like vendor and product identifiers) - even if "
"the intended driver is sufficiently secure, the device may try to attack a "
"different, less secure driver. Furthermore that VM has full control of the "
"device and may be able to exploit bugs or malicious implementation of the "
"hardware, as well as plain security problems the hardware may pose. (For "
"example, if you attach a USB controller, all the security implications of "
"USB passthrough apply as well.)"

"By default, Qubes requires any PCI device to be resettable from the outside "
"(i.e. via the hypervisor), which completely reinitialises the device. This "
"ensures that any device that was attached to a compromised VM, even if that "
"VM was able to use bugs in the PCI device to inject malicious code, can be "
"trusted again. (Or at least as trusted as it was when Qubes booted.)"

"Some devices do not implement a reset option. In these cases, Qubes by "
"default does not allow attaching the device to any VM. If you decide to "
"override this precaution, beware that the device may only be trusted when "
"attached to the first VM. Afterwards, it should be **considered tainted** "
"until the whole system is shut down. Even without malicious intent, usage "

"In case device reset is disabled for any reason, detaching the device should"

"Additionally, Qubes restricts the config-space a VM may use to communicate "
"with a PCI device. Only whitelisted registers are accessible. However, some "
"devices or applications require full PCI access. In these cases, the whole "
"config-space may be allowed. You’re potentially weakening the device "
"isolation, especially if your system is not equipped with a VT-d Interrupt "
"Remapping unit. This increases the VM’s ability to run a `side channel "
"attack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack>`__ and "
"vulnerability to the same. See `Xen PCI Passthrough: PV guests and PCI "

"The connection of an untrusted USB device to dom0 is a security risk since "
"the device can attack an arbitrary USB driver (which are included in the "
"linux kernel), exploit bugs during partition-table-parsing or simply pretend"
" to be a keyboard. There are many ready-to-use implementations of such "
"attacks, e.g. a `USB Rubber Ducky <https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-"
"rubber-ducky-deluxe>`__. The whole USB stack is put to work to parse the "
"data presented by the USB device in order to determine if it is a USB mass "
"storage device, to read its configuration, etc. This happens even if the "
"drive is then assigned and mounted in another qube."

"If you connect USB input devices (keyboard and mouse) to a VM, that VM will "
"effectively have control over your system. Because of this, the benefits of "
"using a :doc:`USB qube </user/advanced-topics/usb-qubes>` entrusted with a "
"keyboard or other interface device are much smaller than using a fully "
"untrusted USB qube. In addition to having control over your system, such a "

"If you have only a USB mouse connected to a USB qube, but the keyboard is "
"connected directly to dom0 (using a PS/2 connector, for example), you simply"
" need to lock the screen when you are away from your computer (assuming you "
"don’t use the virtual keyboard of your screen locker). You must do this "
"every time you leave your computer unattended, even if there no risk of "
"anyone else having direct physical access to your computer. This is because "
"you are guarding the system not only against anyone with local access, but "
"also against possible malicious input from a potentially compromised USB "
"qube."

"If your keyboard is also connected to a USB qube, things are much harder. "
"Locking the screen (with a traditional password) does not solve the problem,"
" because the USB qube can simply sniff this password and later easily unlock"
" the screen. One possibility is to set up the screen locker to require an "
"additional step to unlock (i.e., two-factor authentication). One way to "
"achieve this is to use a :doc:`YubiKey </user/security-in-qubes/yubi-key>`, "
"or some other hardware token, or even to manually enter a one-time password."
"  Support for `two factor authentication <https://www.qubes-"
"os.org/news/2018/09/11/qubes-u2f-proxy/>`__ was recently added, though there"
" are `issues <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4661>`__."
