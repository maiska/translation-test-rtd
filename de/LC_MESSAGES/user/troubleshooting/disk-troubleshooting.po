"If the disk is completely full, you will get an ``Out of disk space`` error "
"that may crash your system because Dom0 does not have enough disk space to "
"work. So it’s good practice to regularly check disk space usage. Running the"
" ``df -h`` command in dom0 terminal will show some information, but not "
"include all the relevant details. The Qubes user interface provides a disk "
"space widget. If you are unable to access the interface, the command line "
"version is running ``sudo lvs | head`` and looking at top entry for LVM "
"pool. For example:"
