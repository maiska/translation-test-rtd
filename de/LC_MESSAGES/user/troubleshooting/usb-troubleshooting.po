"To successfully attach a USB device, you require a VM dedicated to handling "
"the USB input and output. For guidance setting up a USB qube, see the "
":ref:`USB documentation <user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-devices:creating "
"and using a usb qube>`.  Currently (until issue `1082 "
"<https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1082>`__ gets implemented), "
"if you remove the device before detaching it from the qube, Qubes OS (more "
"precisely, ``libvirtd``) will think that the device is still attached to the"
" qube and will not allow attaching further devices under the same name. This"
" may be characterized by VM manager crashes and the error message: "
"``Houston, we have a problem``. The easiest way to recover from such a "
"situation is to reboot the qube to which the device was attached. If this "
"isn’t an option, you can manually recover from the situation by following "
"the instructions at the :ref:`Block Devices documentation <user/how-to-"
"guides/how-to-use-block-storage-devices:what if i removed the device before "
"detaching it from the vm>`"
