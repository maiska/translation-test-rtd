         <p>
           Qubes OS is a free and open-source, security-oriented operating system for
           single-user desktop computing. Qubes OS leverages
           <a href="https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Software_Overview">
           Xen-based virtualization</a> to allow for the creation and management of
           isolated compartments called <a href="/doc/glossary#qube">qubes</a>.

Why Qubes OS?

   <h3>

Physical isolation is a given safeguard that the digital world lacks

.. container:: row

   .. container:: col-lg-6 col-md-6 text-left

      ::

         <p>
           Throughout our lives, we engage in various activities, such as going to
           school, working, voting, taking care of our families, and visiting with
           friends. These activities are spatially and temporally bound: They happen
           in isolation from one another, in their own compartments, which often
           represent an essential safeguard, as in the case of voting.
         </p>
         <p>
           In our digital lives, the situation is quite different: All of our
           activities typically happen on a single device. This causes us to worry
           about whether it's safe to click on a link or install an app, since being
           hacked imperils our entire digital existence.
         </p>
         <p>
           Qubes eliminates this concern by allowing us to divide a device into many
           compartments, much as we divide a physical building into many rooms.
           Better yet, it allows us to create new compartments whenever we need them,
           and it gives us sophisticated tools for securely managing our activities
           and data across these compartments.
         </p>

Qubes allows you to compartmentalize your digital life

         <p>
           Many of us are initially surprised to learn that our devices do not
           support the kind of secure compartmentalization that our lives demand, and
           we're disappointed that software vendors rely on generic defenses that
           repeatedly succumb to new attacks.
         </p>
         <p>
           In building Qubes, our working assumption is that all software contains
           bugs. Not only that, but in their stampeding rush to meet deadlines, the
           world's stressed-out software developers are pumping out new code at a
           staggering rate &mdash; far faster than the comparatively smaller
           population of security experts could ever hope to analyze it for
           vulnerabilities, much less fix everything. Rather than pretend that we can
           prevent these inevitable vulnerabilities from being exploited, we've
           designed Qubes under the assumption that they <em>will</em> be exploited.
           It's only a matter of time until the next zero-day attack.
         </p>
         <p>
           In light of this sobering reality, Qubes takes an eminently practical
           approach: confine, control, and contain the damage. It allows you to keep
           valuable data separate from risky activities, preventing
           cross-contamination. This means you can do everything on the same
           physical computer without having to worry about a single successful
           cyberattack taking down your entire digital life in one fell swoop. In
           fact, Qubes has
           <a href="https://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/2014/Software_compartmentalization_vs_physical_separation.pdf">
           distinct advantages over physical air gaps</a>.

           Qubes provides practical, usable security to vulnerable and
           actively-targeted individuals, such as journalists, activists,
           whistleblowers, and researchers. Qubes is designed with the understanding
           that people make mistakes, and it allows you to protect yourself from your
           own mistakes. It's a place where you can click on links, open attachments,
           plug in devices, and install software free from worry. It's a place where
           <em>you</em> have control over your software, not the other way around.
         </p>
         <p>
           Qubes is also powerful. Organizations like the <a

           security internet technologies that are in turn relied upon by countless
           users around the world every day. Renowned security <a

           Qubes is one of the few operating systems that places the security of
           its users above all else. It is, and always will be, free and open-source
           software, because the fundamental operating system that constitutes the
           core infrastructure of our digital lives <em>must</em> be free and
           open-source in order to be trustworthy.
