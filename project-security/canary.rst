Qubes canaries
==============

A **Qubes canary** is a security announcement periodically issued by the :ref:`Qubes security team <project-security/security:qubes security team>` through the :doc:`Qubes security pack </project-security/security-pack>` consisting of several
statements to the effect that the signers of the canary have not been
compromised. The idea is that, as long as signed canaries including such
statements continue to be published, all is well. However, if the
canaries should suddenly cease, if one or more signers begin declining
to sign them, or if the included statements change significantly without
plausible explanation, then this may indicate that something has gone
wrong.

The name originates from the practice in which miners would bring caged
canaries into coal mines. If the level of methane gas in the mine
reached a dangerous level, the canary would die, indicating to miners
that they should evacuate. See `Wikipedia: warrant canary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary>`__ for more
information, but bear in mind that Qubes Canaries are not strictly
limited to legal warrants.
